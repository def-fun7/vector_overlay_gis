# Overlay in GIS

In GIS, **Overlay** is defined as ``the process of taking two or more
different thematic maps of the same area and placing them on top of
one another to form a new map'' It is a GIS operation
that superimposes multiple datasets (representing different themes)
together for the purpose of identifying relationships between them.
It does not only combines the spatial features of the
datasets but also the attribute information in them as well. In simple, It creates
a composite map by combining the geometry and attributes of the
input datasets. Tools are available in most GIS software for
overlaying both vector or raster data.

This sentence uses `$` delimiters to show math inline: $\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$

## Math Test

Inline: $E = mc^2$

Block:
$$
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right)
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
$$
